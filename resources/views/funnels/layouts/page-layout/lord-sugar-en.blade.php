                    <p>Social media has recently been buzzing with news that <strong>Lord Sugar</strong> has been
                        earning millions, to the tune of £2,000 per hour, with a new “secret system” from the United
                        States. A source close to Sugar revealed the news by mistake, which has since been shared on
                        Facebook and reported on national television and press. At EuroMarket, we wanted to find out the
                        truth about these “secret money systems” that he has been using to see if they really worked.
                    </p>

                </div>

                <div class="clear"></div>

                <p style="margin-top:0;"><b>LONDON </b> – It has been revealed that Sugar has been trading with a system
                    called “<a href="https://skylinemarkets.com/EN/open-account{{$parameters}}" target="blank">Binary Options</a>”
                    which
                    initially became famous in the United States where many people made thousands or even millions of
                    dollars with little effort using a unique trick to always beat the market. Earlier this year the US
                    TV documentary show “60 Minutes” did a special report interviewing people who earned money from the
                    system.They explained that the reason it was secret for so long is that anyone can use it.
                    Authorities in the US have been trying to stop Americans from using the system, fearing that this
                    new technology could create so much wealth it could cause disruption to the financial power houses
                    that try to uphold the “status quo”. One insider, who would not be named in the documentary
                    elaborated, “this system can make working class Americans wealthy overnight. This makes the
                    political elite nervous as they want to maintain control”. However, outside the US, there are no
                    restrictions over this trading technique and since January 2015 it has been estimated thousands of
                    new millionaires have already been created worldwide. </p>
                <p>A source from a leading consultancy stated “Binary trading is now creating many more weekly
                    millionaires than the lottery. In fact, we are seeing 90% of new clients seeking wealth advice now
                    earn their main income from binary trading. What is astounding is that many of these people were
                    working in regular jobs, like construction, office jobs and even unemployed and now they are earning
                    more than top stockbrokers in London, New York or Tokyo.” </p>
                <p> As part of our investigation into these claims, EuroMarket managed to track down a British man who
                    had used the secret system. His name is <strong>Darren Lewis</strong> and he has published a diary
                    of his first week earning with the system. Before he started trading with binary options, Darren was
                    working in a low paid office job. Since then, this story has become famous on the web. We have
                    published the diary excerpt below, with an exclusive article from Mr. Lewis himself. EuroMarket has
                    verified the validity of Mr. Lewis's statements to be accurate. This is just one example of
                    thousands of people, worldwide, who have started to trade this year with Binary Options. The
                    following diary extract is a truly amazing account of his first week's trading. </p>

                    <blockquote><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span
                                        style="color: #333333; text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Day One</strong></span></span>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            On day one, I signed up with the simple registration form. I lodged some trading funds using
                            my debit card. I was aware that this was 100% refundable if I decided not to continue, so I
                            was happy with this. On the first day, I looked at the site and I could see that my balance
                            was $250. I felt great excitement about starting to trade, after all the news about people
                            earning huge money from that system. I “executed” my first trade, with help from the site,
                            it was so easy. Is that all I had to do? I went to bed and decided I would check it when I
                            got back to work the next day.
                        </p>
                        <p><img class="aligncenter" src="/img/lord-sugar-en/tm-650.png" alt="" width="650"></p>
                        <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Day Two</strong></span></p>
                        <p>On day two, I woke up and rushed to work. I had slept in and was going to be late for my
                            train. When I got to the office, I checked my emails and drank my coffee. Then, I
                            remembered, I forgot to check my trade! It was already 10:45am, so it was almost 12 hours
                            since I placed it. I logged into the site, feeling nervous and excited. Would my funds still
                            be there? I felt a little anxious… </p>
                        <p>I opened the dashboard of the site. I thought at first I had made a mistake. Was this my
                            account? I double checked the account name in the corner, yes it was mine. At that point, I
                            almost spilled my coffee! I could see that my new balance at that time was $1,550.
                            Incredible! In only 12 hours, while I was sleeping, the account made $1,200 profit from the
                            $250 that I had funded. I’m glad I remembered to make a screenshot of it, so you can see
                            below what I saw that morning. I wrote to my account manager at SkyLineMarkets. Amazingly,
                            he was not as surprised as I was. “This is normal” he said, “in fact, we often see people
                            earning more than that in the first 12 hours”. I was impressed, this thing was really
                            working. For the rest of the day, I could hardly concentrate on my job. </p>

                        </p>
                        <p> On day three of my trading, I was really getting into it. I could see that this wasn’t some
                            sort of complicated system for fund managers and stockbrokers. This was easy and not only
                            that, it was very clear how I was earning so much money. During my apprentice years, I wrote
                            an article about day trading in London and New York. I recall that a senior trader at a firm
                            told me that in any single day, there are “thousands of billions” of dollars traded on
                            currency, oil, gold and shares. This is not “millions”, not even “billions” but in fact
                            “millions of billions!”. This was hard to even understand, but it is clear that every single
                            minute, a trader can earn thousands of profit without any effort. Somehow, binary trading
                            opens up these possibilities to all of us. It may be the most powerful money making tool
                            ever created. I made some more trades on SkyLineMarkets on Day 3. I spent about 15 minutes
                            doing that. And another 30 minutes checking back on my trades every now and then. By the
                            time I went to bed, my account had reached an incredible $11,405. I started to dream about
                            spending this, I could pay off my credit card debt. I could buy a new car. But I decided to
                            wait longer and see how much I could make. </p>
                        <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="/img/lord-sugar-en/screenshot2.jpg"/ alt="Screenshot day
                            two" /></p>
                        <p><img class="aligncenter" src="/img/lord-sugar-en/tm-650.png" alt="" width="650"/></p>
                        <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Day Four</strong></span></p>
                        <p>Today, things really took off. My advisor at <a
                                    href="https://skylinemarkets.com/EN/open-account{{$parameters}}" target="blank">SkyLineMarkets</a>
                            explained that the more money I made, the more I could potentially earn. I made a few more
                            trades. The end of day balance was an astounding $38,785. This was much more than I earn in
                            a year. In just 4 remarkable days, I had earned enough to travel the world with my
                            girlfriend, first class! She didn’t even know about my success yet. I booked a table at a 5
                            star hotel for the weekend to tell her about this amazing story. I decided I would pay off
                            her student debt so that she could continue to pursue her dream as a fashion buyer. This
                            money was going to change our lives.</p>
                        <p><img class="aligncenter" src="/img/lord-sugar-en/tm-650.png" alt="" width="650"/></p>
                        <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Day Five</strong></span></p>
                        <p>On day 5, I started to realise that things were getting serious. My balance had now exceeded
                            $100,000. I felt intense joy but also just a little anxiety, if you can believe it! This was
                            so much money in MY account, how was I going to deal with it? Thankfully, SkyLineMarkets
                            were able to help with this too. “We help to create so many new millionaires, we actually
                            have a special department dealing with these issues” he said. It’s called the “Diamond Club”
                            and when members reach $100,000 in their account, we can offer some advice on how to manage
                            your new wealth. But I already knew what I wanted to do, I had a wish list. I was going to
                            pay all my debt, which was about $8,000. I also would pay my girlfriend’s debt, as I
                            mentioned before. Next month would be my mother’s birthday and I decided to get her a great
                            gift that she would treasure. I also did something that felt good. I walked into the
                            Mercedez Benz showroom and took a new car for a test drive. The price tag was £35,000. It
                            still felt expensive, I didn’t want to spend it on that...just yet. But it felt great to
                            know that I could and I decided that if things kept going like this, I would return and buy
                            it, without any loan.</p>
                        <p><img class="aligncenter" src="/img/lord-sugar-en/tm-650.png" alt="" width="650"/></p>
                        <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Day Six</strong></span></p>
                        <p>When I woke up on Day 6, I checked my stats on my phone first thing. I didn’t need to worry
                            about rushing for the train, because I had already arranged for a limo to collect me that
                            morning. Sure, the cost would be high, but I wanted to see the look on my boss’s face when I
                            pulled up at our office in a sleek black stretch limo! I felt like Gordon Gecko in the movie
                            “Wall St.” and it was so much fun. I decided that I didn’t want to spend every day working
                            for minimum wage when I could earn so much working from home (if you could call it
                            working!). I quit my job and gave a huge gift basket for all my friends in the office. Some
                            people thought maybe I had won the lottery. I didn’t tell them about my secret. I wanted to
                            wait and reveal it first to my girlfriend. </p>
                        <p><img class="aligncenter" src="/img/lord-sugar-en/tm-650.png" alt="" width="650"/></p>
                        <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Day Seven</strong></span></p>
                        <p>The last day of my “diary” was a Sunday. I don’t work on Sunday and today would be no
                            different. But that would not stop my account from increasing. Trading markets are open
                            every day of the week, so while I was reading the newspaper and drinking my coffee, my
                            account was going up all the time. On this, the last day of my diary, I took a final
                            screenshot of my account, which I am sharing with you today. You may need to pinch yourself
                            to see if you are dreaming! Imagine how I felt! The final balance at the end of the week,
                            was a staggering $1,075,235.50. Yes, that’s right, I had earned over 1 million US dollars.
                            In my FIRST WEEK. At this point, I withdrew much of my funds. I didn’t want to risk losing
                            it, although there was probably no risk at all. I left about $75,000 in the account and
                            transferred over $1million over to my personal bank account. Within 5 minutes I got a phone
                            call from my bank manager. “We just received 1 million to your bank account Mr. Lewis. Where
                            did these funds come from?” he asked me. And when I responded with “SkyLineMarkets- options
                            trading” there was a pause. Then, he said “Ah, I thought so. You are not the first client at
                            this bank we have seen earning large funds from that source.” Then, he invited me in to
                            discuss investment opportunities. Imagine that… only 1 week ago, I had been declined a new
                            credit card because of my poor debt history. I was working on minimum wage, barely enough to
                            pay the bills. Now, the manager was rolling out the red carpet and inviting me in for a
                            private meeting. </p>

                <hr/>

                <p>In these difficult economic times, everyone deserves an opportunity to earn extra cash, not just rich
                    celebrities and bank managers that keep all the secrets to themselves. That is why I decided to
                    expose this secret to everyone. You may not earn millions, nobody can promise this, but remember
                    even £10,000 can make a huge difference. You can pay your debt, not worry about the bills or the
                    rent and have the holiday of a lifetime. For me, I’m still doing some trading and <a
                            href="https://skylinemarkets.com/EN/open-account{{$parameters}}" target="blank">SkyLineMarkets</a> are
                    helping
                    me to adjust to my new status as a “millionnaire”. </p>
                <p>As a consumer, you may have your doubts about the effects of this trading, but you should give it a
                    try and test it; the results are real. I experienced it myself. And there is nothing to lose, as the
                    trading platform does offer a full refund to your initial deposit if you don’t want to trade. </p>
                <p>I hope you have good luck and make those extra dollars…. just like Lord Sugar! I wish you every
                    success.</p>
