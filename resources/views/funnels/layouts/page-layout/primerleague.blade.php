                                    couldn’t believe what she discovered when she sat down with one household Premier League footballer and established England international. Think you know what your favourite footballer gets up to off the pitch? Think again!
                                </div>
                                <p><strong>London, England</strong> – It’s no secret that uber-rich male sports stars are forever being chased by young girls looking for a taste of the high life. But what might surprise you is just how many Premier League footballers are falling to temptation.</p>
                                <p>In a rare and candid interview, I spoke to a well-known Premier League footballer and England international, who revealed that in his dressing room alone, 1 in 3 players were cheating on their partners.</p>
                                <p>But that wasn’t the most shocking revelation made by our Premier League insider, as you’ll discover in just a moment...</p>
                            </div>
                            <p><strong>Hi, and thanks for talking with me today.</strong></p>
                            <p>No problem at all.</p>
                            <p><strong>A footballer cheating on his wife or partner is a pretty common story in the news these days. Is it fair to label all footballers this way?</strong></p>
                            <p>
                                No of course not. Not all of us are like that. I’ve been married for 4 years and I wouldn’t dream of it. But there are a lot of players who stray. Whenever I go out with the guys there are young girls throwing themselves at us, which for some of the players, is very hard to resist. They want the lifestyle that comes with being a footballer’s wife.
                            </p>
                            <p><strong>So how many players in your dressing room have cheated on their wives or partners?</strong></p>
                            <p>
                                I’d say 1 in 3, easily. I’m pretty close to a lot of them (as a friend, he points out laughing), and I know what they get up to. I don’t condone it. But I can’t stop it either. It’s their life at the end of the day.
                            </p>
                            <p>

                            </p>
                            <p>"Anyone can use this method to make as much as £350 a day from home..."</p>
                            <p><strong>We chat a little more about footballers and their unfaithful ways, but it’s when we turn to the subject of money – which Premier League players are never short of – that the conversation starts to get really interesting.</strong></p>
                            <p>
                                In fact, our Premier League insider reveals something that I had no idea about – that a large proportion of players are now supplementing their salaries with something known as binary options trading.
                            </p>
                            <p><strong>So what is binary options trading, and how much money are footballers making from it?</strong></p>
                            <p>
                                The answer will surprise you. And as our Premier League star revealed, it’s so simple, anyone can use this method to make as much as £200 a day from home, easily and 100% legally.
                            </p>
                            <p><strong>Many of our readers, who work regular 9-5 jobs, get fed up hearing how much money footballers earn. What’s your answer to that?</strong></p>
                            <p>
                                Yes, I read the papers too, and I understand how the regular football fan feels because of what’s reported. But despite the perception, not all Premier League players earn fantasy amounts of money. The smaller clubs have very tight wage structures to protect themselves in case of relegation, so a lot of their players aren’t earning anywhere near the levels that many people on the outside seem to think. In fact, there’s a growing trend amongst the players for supplementing their income with binary options trading. It’s great fun and very easy to master, which a lot of the players like about it. We’re not the smartest after all!
                            </p>
                            <p><strong>Ok, I haven’t heard about that. How did that start?</strong></p>
                            <p>
                                As far as I know, a player at a top 4 club (who I’d rather not name) started playing around with it, made some money, and told all the guys in the dressing room. Within a few weeks, the news had spread around the clubs about how much simple it was, and now there are literally hundreds of players, from both the Premier League and the Championship and below, who are involved with binary options trading. They love it, and a lot of them are making extra money trading on the mobile app while traveling on the tour bus or in the locker rooms after training.
                            </p>
                            <p><strong>Are you doing it?</strong></p>
                            <p>
                                Yes, I am now. It’s super easy and I‘m getting pretty good at it! I hadn’t even heard about it until 3 months ago when the rumour reached our club and a few of the guys started trying it. I thought it would be really difficult to master and make money from, but it’s much easier than I imagined. Unlike traditional stock market trading, binary option trades are really fast. They usually last only 15 minutes, so you can see a return very quickly – and then get back to dinner, your favourite TV show, or training!
                            </p>
                            <p><strong>I’m intrigued! So how does it work? Can anyone start doing it?</strong></p>
                            <p>
                                Yes, absolutely. You can sign up for a free account and get going straight away. All you need to do is predict whether the price of an asset, such as a Apple, Facebook, Google, Barclays. Gold, EUR/USD will go up or down in a set time period, which as I said, is often less than 15 minutes. So it’s great fun, and very simple to do. The returns are excellent too. I started with a deposit of just £200 and I’d tripled it within the first week. I now make around £3,000 a month, but I try to be careful and not trade with too much. I’m not saying everyone will be able to do make this kind of money. I can obviously only speak from my own experience, but it really works.
                            </p>
                            <div class="visual"><img src="/img/premiereleague/img05.jpg" height="435" width="773" alt="image description"></div>
                            <p><strong>Wow, so are a lot of your fellow players making really big money doing this?</strong></p>
                            <p>Sure, some of them are. But obviously, the players from the major clubs have a lot more money to trade with, so it’s all relative. The lower league players trade with smaller amounts, of course.</p>
                            <p><strong>Is this something an everyday person can do as well, or do you need experience of trading?</strong></p>
                            <p>Not at all. You don’t need any experience or knowledge of trading. I definitely didn’t have any! An everyday person can easily supplement their income too. They won’t become millionaires, but they can make really good returns: several thousand pounds a month easy. I’d definitely recommend it. I’ve noticed that most people in this country haven’t heard about it though, which is why so few people do it. (Editor’s note: there’s a detailed explanation about how to get started below).</p>
                            <p><strong>Thanks so much for speaking with me, and for revealing how your fellow professionals are spending their free time! I had no idea.</strong></p>
                            <p>No problem at all. It’s been great talking, and I hope some of your readers are able to benefit like I have. Like I said, you won’t make millions, and that’s not really the aim. But you can easily generate a few thousand extra a month. My wife and I (who I’m very faithful to I might add (laughs), put all of my trading income into a separate account which we use to pay for holidays, and for the kids’ school fees and things like that. It makes a big difference, and it’s definitely worth a try.</p>
                            <p>At the end of the interview, I’m desperate to try out binary options trading for myself.</p>
                            <p>I mean, if this really is as effective as he claims, then it’s pretty exciting.</p>
                            <p>So I immediately head on over insider’s trading company of choice, anyoption, which according to their website, were the first online financial trading website to specialise in binary options.</p>
                            <p>It sounds amazing, but I was naturally quite sceptical.</p>
                            <p>After all, the internet is awash with money making schemes, so I was determined to put it to the test myself.</p>
                            <p>So with my editor’s blessing I decided to sign up for a free account with anyoption and start trading!</p>
                            <p><strong>So how did I do?</strong></p>

                                <em>If you’ve been inspired by Helen’s story, here’s what you need to do to get started as a binary options trader...</em>
                                <h2>How to get started...</h2>
                                <span class="step-title"><mark>STEP #1:</mark> JOIN FREE</span>
                                <p>To begin using this strategy, you first need to sign up to a trading platform. There are quite a few platforms available, but from my experience the best by far is anyoption, the first and biggest binary broker, and the most popular platform amongst the Premier League stars.</p>
                                <p>Not only is it really easy to use for beginners, with a ‘training academy’ section on their website which includes trading guides, videos and tutorials for beginners, but they also offer the largest pay-outs of any broker I’ve seen, and they make payments quickly as well – which is really important. Plus, unlike a lot of other companies out there, you can join completely free!</p>
                                <span class="step-title"><mark>STEP #2:</mark> MAKE A DEPOSIT</span>
                                <p>Of course, in order to trade you need to deposit some money. But it doesn’t have to be much, so don’t worry! In fact, anyoption allows you to start with a deposit of just £200 and trade as little as £25 at a time. I’d definitely recommend that you start small, and then work your way up towards bigger trades and bigger profits as you become more experienced.</p>
                                <span class="step-title"><mark>STEP #3:</mark> PLACE YOUR TRADE!</span>
                                <p>After you’ve signed up and made your deposit, you will be automatically forwarded to the trading page. The good news is, there are only two options to choose from: if you think the price will go UP, you place a ‘call’ trade. If you think it will go DOWN, you place a ‘put’ trade. It’s that simple! All you then need to do is enter an amount you wish to trade with in order to purchase the option. All of the trades have returns of anywhere between 70% - 80%, and you can make money in as little as 15 minutes!</p>
